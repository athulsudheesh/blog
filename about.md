I read, think and write.

I am a Cognitive Neuroscientist specialized in Computational Modeling, who is on a never-ending journey to understand the human mind. Before changing career, I was an electronics engineer and was the founder and CEO of Dionz Electronics, a consumer electronics startup in India. In my years both as a cognitive scientist and electronics engineer I was lucky enough to host many successful projects and much more unsuccessful projects.

Besides writing I also enjoy [photography](https://www.instagram.com/athulsudheesh/) and is on a serious attempt to learn guitar.
